            <p>Asta was an orphan who was born without any magical ability in a world where magic defines one's status, Asta’s primary goal is to become the Wizard King, the highest magical rank. Despite his lack of magic, he wields an extraordinary power known as "Anti-Magic," which allows him to nullify other spells and is embodied in his magical swords. His unwavering drive and physical prowess, honed through relentless training, set him apart from others. Asta's journey is marked by his fierce rivalry with his childhood friend Yuno, who is exceptionally gifted, but their rivalry is underpinned by a deep mutual respect. As Asta evolves, he grows not only in strength but also in character, forming strong bonds with his Black Bulls teammates and uncovering more about himself and the world.</p>
